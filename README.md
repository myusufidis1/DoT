Democracy of Things (DoT): Volumes &amp; Digital Assets

Summary list of research papers relevant to the research context of this project, conducted over 2017 through 2019.  An overview of the research the applicant has conducted during the master’s program to position for this Integration Project as the final step towards graduation. 

Democracy of Things Vol 1: A progressive cybernetics eco-system & interaction model concept  

The first in the series of smart cities centric material, the smart cities eco-system is explored.  Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are discussed.  A progressive cybernetics eco-system and interaction model is conceptualized. 

Democracy of Things Vol 2: An exploration of digital democracy & citizen IS applications 

In this volume, digital channels and an ontology of digital democracy communities are explored; (open) big data and crowdsourcing are singled out as accelerators.  It is in this paper, where we get an initial sense of how technology transformation and progression has impacted both our capabilities and opportunities as a key cause for why we haven’t achieved and exploited our full potential with this thriving industry, smart cities.  The technology wasn’t there, IoT, Big (Open) Data and Cloud are the game changers, SaaS, agile processes and DevOps makes smart cities technologically feasible. 

Democracy of Things Vol 3: The Future of Online Gaming as a Civic Service 

In this volume, the use case of reusing gaming assets and artificial intelligence from gaming open worlds for civic development is explored.  Leading-edge case studies are explored of online digital game platforms such as Minecraft being leveraged for urban planning and smart city development.

Democracy of Things Vol 4: RLO – Process Tailoring & Creation Unified Process 

This volume takes an abstract turn away from smart cities temporarily and aims to demystify technology delivery processes.  It advocates for tailoring and adaptation as key techniques in an agile and DevOps environment. It also advocates for measurement and interpretation of data into meaningful information.  It contributes Creation Unified Process, a Storytelling driven business and technology delivery framework. It includes discussion of mechanisms for agile process engineering and tailoring including the Eclipse Process Framework and Process Composer tools. 

Democracy of Things Vol 5: Progressive Cybernetics – Smart Contracts (& The Blockchain) 

Blockchain and smart contracts in the context of civic use are explored in depth within this volume.  The research and discussion advocates exploring use of non-currency-based applications of Blockchain technology. The R3 Corda platform, Java/Kotlin based, was used to deliver a prototype smart contract emulating project governance.  

Democracy of Things Vol 6: Digital Twin System Creation – For Smart Cities 

This volume tackles smart cities in the context of the sharing economy and industry 4.0.  Research includes exploring Digital Twin (industry 4.0) technology and posits a process to create a digital twin as a system sequence architecture, heavily focused on messaging (sensors => data) and communications between the virtual digital twin and physical environment.   It treads on how the intelligence core of a (virtual) digital twin could think; and it posits with certainty that a smart city, can be modelled as a (virtual) digital twin given an Atlanta based case study.

Democracy of Things Vol 7: Modern Modelling Techniques & Design Thinking 

Abstracting higher than the smart cities theme, in this volume, the Scale Agile Framework is noted as a progressive delivery and modelling technique.  The volume also begins to explore Design Thinking techniques that can be applied by any organization, specifically immersive storytelling and journey maps; and with Design Thinking as the central innovation mechanism, posits that LEGO Serious Play THE METHOD, encapsulates an abstract method that can be adapted by and complement many different business and technology ideation and design processes.
